##                          **__Cloud MQTT based RFID Attendance system using Internet of Things__**

Taking traditional manual pen-paper attendance, which is very time-consuming, insecure and usually leads to human errors as well as prone to misconduct, as the valuable time and work gets wasted in organizing and structuring the attendance data in registers. Hence to overcome this major hectic problem, we have used relational database management system in real time with appropriate security measures to access, manipulate and represent the data on the basis of the unique RFID tags, which gets fast and easily scanned on the RFID reader. This system consists of hardware and software with most trending implementation of a lightweight MQTT protocol in IoT technology; designed to take an attendance on the basis of RFID technology with NodeMCU firmware. The main objective of this proposed system is to make the effective and efficient computerized attendance on cloud platform (Adafruit). This proposed system is an entirely green and clean way and novel approach to flourishing in the IoT era.
